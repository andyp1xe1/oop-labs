The sun dipped below the horizon, casting shadows across the empty street. Cats, they wandered, silent and watchful, as if waiting for something. A distant siren echoed, then faded into the night. Was it always this quiet? Sometimes, the trees whispered secretsâ€”lost dreams? They swayed, gently, almost like dancing. Footsteps approached, hurried, then paused. Someone was out there. Fragments of laughter drifted from somewhere, teasing, taunting. The air thick with anticipation, something was coming, or maybe it was just the wind? A light flickered in a window, then disappeared. Did anyone notice? Uncertainty hung, heavy, as the stars began to twinkle above.
